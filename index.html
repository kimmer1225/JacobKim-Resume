        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello my name is Jacob Kim and I am 19 years old. I have 2 parents and a little sister. I am currently a second year undergraduate at the University of California, Riverside as a Sociology major. Growing up, I lived in Chino Hills, California and attended Townsend Junior high and Damien High School. Throughout my 4 years at Damien HIgh School, I was a baseball player. I started my baseball career when I was in little league and pursued my interest throughout highschool. Throughout my baseball career I have participated in many tournaments and made a lot of new friends of whom I still keep in touch with. As of now, Baseball has still been my passion although I cannot partake in baseball activities because I am a full time student and part-time worker at Boba Time Riverside. 
<br><br>

        I have been working at this job for about two months now and I have enjoyed working at Boba Time Riverside so far. The tasks given to me vary from making drinks, cleaning, cooking, moving things, interacting with customers, and more. I have learned how to talk to customers and how to work efficiently. I have also learned how to work better in an environment with others due to the cramped space and the many workers. However, this is not my first job. Before I worked at Boba Time Riverside I worked for a company called MAXQ. MAXQ is a company responsible for manufacturing and producing metal works for many other companies around the nation. I worked here for about 3 months and through that I gained a lot of valuable work experience. Some of the things that I did consisted of making metal parts for a number of different college stadiums such as Vanderbilt and more. But one of the more notable things was making parts for the Los Angeles Rams stadium. After working here for a summer I was able to apply these skills to my school work, from completing my work efficiently and on time to managing my time well in order to have an allotted amount of time to do anything else.
<br><br>

        I have learned a lot of things about how to work with others in multiple environments and I have applied these experiences in order to better myself. I hope that throughout all the events that happen in my life, from work to school and any other events that may occur, I can apply it to other aspects of my career.
